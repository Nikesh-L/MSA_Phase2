"Chelsea gets transfer banned, spends nothing for a full year, then finishes top 4 and in the finals of the FA Cup, bringing in lots of revenue to the club at literally 0 expenses because Lampard managed to do this using youth academy graduates.,Then they spend money in a window where no one else has money, which obviously allows us for some insane deals and good value for money.,Haters: uh Abramovich oil money owner shit youth academy buying players chelsea duh"
Yet we still gave the hotels to the NHS workers & paying the staff..

I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúrent boys‚Äù come back in full force as well. What a shame people who don‚Äôt know our club throwing senseless banter around.

"Liverpool still act like they‚Äôre the plucky underdogs who win against all odds, it‚Äôs one thing getting to the top, it‚Äôs a whole other thing staying there"
"As a Red Sox fan, John Henry knows how to frugally build a champion then destroy it from within (either because he's either beholden to the 'bottom line' too much or is clueless about his team's discord/apathy). Give it a season more and Henry will still start to think 'they don't need Klopp'."

"They can give it the big 'un all they like, but all the potshots about transfers show is they are worried that we are coming for them.,Next week Kova is back, Puli should be fit, Havertz a bit more settled, Mendy and Silva in the squad and Timo with games in him. I think we'll be doing our talking on the pitch. KTBFFH."
"There's no chance we start all the new signings though, wont be many changes from this week I would assume."

Yeah it would have been great if we could beat them at anfield. I just want them to be ashamed. But they are shameless

"Klopp accuses us of throwing money about, and when people point out they did too, it becomes ‚ÄúBut they sold Coutinho to fund it‚Äù. We sold Hazard and Morata, which has funded everyone we have bought so far.,We netted ¬£100m+ from players last year. Our five year net spend is -¬£231m, the same as Everton, Wolves, Villa and Arsenal, half as much as City or United.,Liverpool‚Äôs budgeting has been incredible, but Chelsea haven‚Äôt exactly been throwing it about in recent years either."
"Pointed this out to some LFC fan because he was claiming a moral high ground......that Liverpool are more professional and Don't spend like Chelsea......clearly the downvotes showed that Liverpool fans didn't take it too well lol.,Too much salt from other clubs.,Can't wait until werner smashes them lol."
"More importantly- Klopp himself has said that he would have bought Werner if he could but they couldn't afford him, so quite frankly him moaning about us buying the players that he wanted is just acting like a spoiled child."
I believe that they can't even pay for thiago alcantara. They are bargaining even at 30m for a world-class player.
