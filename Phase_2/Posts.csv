The future of Chelsea under Frank Lampard,https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/hnh9mn/the_future_of_chelsea_under_frank_lampard/,"Many of us will have started to notice patterns in the players we have recently been linked with, Frank‚Äôs responses in press conferences, and our new tactics since the restart. I thought it‚Äôll be interesting to join the dots, so I am sharing an interpretation of what we can expect from the team under Frank Lampard, i.e., what tactics we will play, what personnel will fit, and what kind of recruitment will be made to plug the gaps. \[This is just an *interpretation* based on bits and pieces of evidence I have collected; feel free to share your thoughts. Long piece, I know, but worth the read, I hope!\]

**TLDR**: Frank‚Äôs tactics draw significantly upon the Chelsea side he himself played in, most significantly from Ancelotti‚Äôs Chelsea, with shades of Mourinho‚Äôs pragmatism when necessary. He favours a defensive-minded midfielder (Makelele/Essien, and Kante) to protect the centre-backs, the pair of which should have the ideal mix of tactical intelligence, physical presence, aerial dominance and communication (Terry-Carvalho, and almost but not quite, Zouma-Christensen). He prefers two box-to-box midfielders ahead of the defensive mid (Lampard-Ballack, and almost but not quite, Mount-Barkley), and full-backs who can similarly balance attack and defence across the touchline (Ivanovic-Cole, and Azpi/Reece-but not quite Alonso/Emerson).

The players we have been linked with ‚Äî Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Declan Rice ‚Äî all provide missing pieces to the tactical puzzle, with similarities to their past counterparts ‚Äî Ashley Cole, Michael Ballack and John Terry, respectively ‚Äî but also with very important differences, both positive (their flexibility) and negative (their inexperience at the top level). If these transfers go through, however, it could come at the expense of both experienced players (Willian, Jorginho, Kovacic, and potentially, Koulibaly and Tagliafico), and exciting young players from our academy (Tammy, RLC, CHO, Tomori, Ampadu and Billy).

We could hence lose some of the promising progress on academy development from this season, and nevertheless fail to mount a serious title challenge in the immediate future. That is the price we must pay, however, in order to build a solid foundation of a team who can be serious challengers in England and Europe for many years to come, much like we had in the decade after Roman took over. There are very good reasons to be excited about our football in the near future, especially with Frank‚Äôs impressive first season as manager, and the club working towards a coherent long-term vision for the first-team.

## The Kante conundrum

There was a huge debate on this sub in pre-season about Kante‚Äôs best position. The ‚Äúbox-to-box midfielder‚Äù camp felt vindicated when Frank picked up where Sarri left off, playing him ahead of Jorginho. Since the restart, Frank has unexpectedly done a volte-face, with Kante sitting ahead of the defence and Jorginho frozen out. Anyone who has followed Frank‚Äôs tactics at Derby will understand why: he always preferred a mobile defensive-minded midfielder to protect the space in front of the centre-backs in transition. This is very similar to Fernandinho‚Äôs role at City: he has basic capabilities to keep, rotate and progress the ball, but his main advantage is his tactical intelligence in snuffing out counters at their origin, leaving the centre-backs free to physically contest the forward during hold-up play, intercept passes, and track back to guard the box.

City‚Äôs shift from Fernandinho to Rodri, and Chelsea‚Äôs experience with Jorginho under Sarri, exposes the defensive weaknesses in playing a technical player in that position, especially in the PL, where teams at the bottom are experts at defending with low blocks and hitting back with strong hold-up play, efficient long balls (and second balls), and speedy runners ‚Äî neither of which players like Rodri and Jorgi are well-equipped to cope with. Sarri and Guardiola are quite fixated on their possession-based tactics, however, and they have tried various workarounds (like inverted full-backs) to fit a technical player in the pivot, with mixed results.

Sarri himself relied on flanking Jorgi with Kova and Kante: both players are inclined to sit deeper, which meant we were *much* less effective in the forward play, and almost useless without Hazard to break the lines. Neither did this strategy help much, as Kova and Kante would often join the forward play when the low block wouldn‚Äôt break, fail to contribute much going forward, only to leave Jorgi stranded in transition when long balls would bypass the protecting midfielders. We were ultimately outscored by all other sides in the top 6, with half of our goals either scored or assisted by Hazard, and we nevertheless had to suffer the ignominy of those defeats against Bournemouth and City. In the Serie A, Sarri has had better results with this approach: Bentancur, Rabiot, Matuidi and Khedira haven‚Äôt scored a *single* goal between them, but they have supported Pjanic well enough for Juventus to have the best defensive record ‚Äî *even* better than Conte‚Äôs Inter.

This shows that sacrificing cover in transition for incisive build play in the pivot is clearly not feasible in a league like the PL, and Frank has no doubt reflected much on this dilemma during the break ‚Äî particularly the fact that [only Villa have conceded more goals than us from counter-attacks](https://www.skysports.com/football/story-telling/11668/12020591/lampard-how-to-build-a-winning-mentality). Frank initially stuck with Jorgi in the pivot since the team was used to it (not to mention Kante was injured) but the break finally allowed him to ingrain his tactical vision into the team ‚Äî which is mainly inspired from his playing days under two of the modern game‚Äôs best managers, Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti.

## The false three-at-the-back

The main debate on Kante‚Äôs position has revolved around whether he has the ball-playing capabilities to operate in the ‚ÄúMakelele role‚Äù. While our sharpness in ball progression from the back has clearly declined, Kante has silenced the naysayers by maturely managing every minute of the restart in that position until his injury ‚Äî even a hugely demanding game against City. His role is now somewhere between Makelele under Mourinho and Essien under Ancelotti: he is not as proficient at playing the ball forward as the former, but he ensures that we effectively have at least three players to defend at all times.

Several teams use different configurations of such a ‚Äúfalse-three-at-the-back‚Äù. Apart from Fernandinho at City, [United have recently plugged Matic in between the centre-backs to allow the Pogba-Fernandes duo to flourish, to great effect](https://theathletic.com/1903836/2020/07/02/michael-cox-manchester-united-nemanja-matic/). Even Conte‚Äôs Chelsea used Luiz in a free role somewhere between sweeper, centre-back and DM. The logic is simple: if it is a sitting/central player like Matic or Luiz, then the centre-backs drift wide to operate as ad-hoc full backs in transition (made more effective with players like Azpilicueta). If it is a mobile destroyer like Fernandinho or Kante, the centre-backs drift back to cope with the forward, while the destroyer moves into the zone where either the counter is being initiated, or runners are bursting in (both, if the player is as tactically intelligent as Fernandinho or Kante).

Almost all these teams rely on two additional players to support the three-at-the-back: Pep was most successful with inverted full-backs in Walker and Delph; Conte had Kante and Matic ahead to make defensive triangles and give time for the wing-backs to track back; Mourinho was famous for using defensive full-backs in the season we only conceded fifteen goals: Paulo Ferreira wasn‚Äôt the most adventurous right-back, Gallas was effectively a centre-back, but he played on the left in lieu of Bridge, and when Huth played right-back, we actually had *four* centre-backs in an impenetrable defensive line, protected by Makelele ahead.

## The box-to-box eights

While Frank occasionally resorts to Mourinho‚Äôs pragmatism in certain situations (like the City game), the system he draws upon most is Ancelotti‚Äôs Chelsea. Cole and Ivanovic were reliable trackers, but even Frank and Ballack were effectively box-to-box: this meant that the two players to support the three-at-the-back were fluid, which worked because the four tasked with that responsibility were amongst the most tactically intelligent players, who each had a strong understanding of each other‚Äôs movements by then.

Although this was not the most reliable strategy defensively, most teams would sit back against us, so the game was to overwhelm and outscore them. Our points total was lower than Mourinho‚Äôs title-winning seasons, but we routinely scored 4+ goals, not just winning the title but entertaining greatly while we were at it. The system started to crumble as the players aged, however, and it suffered greatly from Essien‚Äôs recurrent injuries.

Frank no doubt remembers his best playing days in midfield alongside Michael Ballack, who was an advanced goal-scoring midfielder before shifting to a deeper playmaking role at Chelsea to enable Frank‚Äôs forward runs. It‚Äôs no surprise then that we are being linked with Kai Havertz, a German midfielder with many similar attributes. Havertz has been used as a number 8, a number 10 (centrally, or on the right-wing), and a false 9, but wherever he is formally deployed, he invariably operates most on the right side of zone 14 (outside the box).

[He has excelled previously as a free 8 in a 4-3-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce6-8eN-DG4&list=WL&index=41&t=0s), progressing the ball elegantly with his link-up play and expansive long passes into space, before arriving between the lines, where he combines deft short passes,  intelligent movement, swift runs in behind, late runs into the edge of the box, and clinical fishing, to great effect. Havertz could potentially line up alongside Mason Mount in a similar German-English number 8 pairing (although there are still questions over the former‚Äôs defensive work-rate). Mount hasn‚Äôt dazzled in terms of goals and assists per se, but his spectacular performances of late have shown just how much he brings to the team beyond statistics, making it clear why he has featured in every game this season. He is not just the ideal box-to-box number 8 in Frank‚Äôs system, but his tactical intelligence and industry would enable Havertz‚Äôs forward movements.

Frank‚Äôs [recent comments](https://www.goal.com/en/news/lampard-kante-may-have-to-change-the-way-he-trains-to-keep/1ckldac5swngy19mg4qs4iqj1r) corroborate this preference for two box-to-box number 8s in front of a defensive number 6:

‚ÄúI spoke of it the other night after the game about teams with low blocks who make it difficult for you. To be able to get players who can arrive with technical ability high up the pitch and around the box and find a pass and take someone out of the game with a skill or finish... It‚Äôs big in those games if we feel like we‚Äôre going to have a lot of control.

Generally, with the midfield, I do like midfield players who can perform, not all the roles but can play high, can play on the side, can do the defensive duties and Mason really has that. His work off the ball is fantastic for us and if I feel like getting him high up the pitch to put more pressure on the other team if they want to play out, that can help us off the ball. Sometimes I‚Äôll ask him to do a slightly different role with the ball where he comes deeper to make sure he‚Äôs not missing out on the ball because he‚Äôs a good player and needs to be on the ball deeper.

Himself and Ross \[Barkley\] can perform that kind of role. Kovacic can perform that kind of role. Ruben Loftus-Cheek can perform that kind of role. N‚ÄôGolo Kante can perform that kind of role. Billy Gilmour can. Jorginho also can but his role predominantly in his career has been from a deeper position. I had those good problems within the team. I like to work on the midfield, making it as fluid as it possibly can be so we give teams problems. Some performances recently, Watford being one the other day, Everton before lockdown I saw a real fluid movement of the midfield which I really liked. We have to continue to work on that.‚Äù

## The fluid full-backs

This further explains some interesting trends we‚Äôve recently seen in the full-back department. Alonso‚Äôs instant omission after the debacle against West Ham is noteworthy, especially since Frank chose to sacrifice his aerial presence after a game when he himself stressed the need for taller players. Gary Neville summed up Alonso‚Äôs main weakness in the commentary box: ‚ÄúHe has two speeds, one running forward, and one running back‚Äù. His failure to track Yarmolenko back during the final West Ham counter was the dealbreaker for Frank: you can be hugely effective in the attacking phase, but the system entirely fails if full-backs fail to manage the transition reliably.

That‚Äôs exactly why the links with Chilwell make a lot of sense: he is young, he has pace, he understands the English game very well, and most importantly, [he balances going forward with tracking back well](https://totalfootballanalysis.com/player-analysis/ben-chilwell-2019-20-scout-report-tactical-analysis-tactics). It‚Äôs no surprise that he got a [testimonial from Ashley Cole](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/11233297/ashley-cole-ben-chilwell-chelsea-fan-leicester/), who himself struck the balance between defense and attack expertly in Ancelotti‚Äôs fluid system. Frank surely believes that he can train Chilwell into a top full-back to meet his tactical demands perfectly, otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be pushing so hard for his transfer. His full-backs don‚Äôt have to be creative playmakers like Trent and Robertson, neither do they need to be defensive rocks like Gallas and Ferreira ‚Äî they mainly need to balance ball progression along the flanks with recovery runs in transition.

On the other side, in Ancelotti‚Äôs system, Ivanovic loved to stay deeper (as a converted centre-back) and drive in crosses from deeper positions. Azpi is not just brilliant defensively, he is our top assist-maker this season, but the similarities to Reece are even greater (notwithstanding his shaky performances of late). Reece‚Äôs crossing is quite obviously his greatest asset, but the most interesting development in the Watford game was his occasional shift to support Billy as an additional defensive midfielder / inverted full-back. It‚Äôs exactly this kind of tactical fluidity that Frank wants to see from his players: the ability to move into spaces depending on the run of the play.

The alternating movement of the full-backs and the 8s has another advantage that makes it appealing to a manager who likes to adapt his tactics game-by-game: it can be customized according to the opponent‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, depending on where they are most dangerous, or the most vulnerable, i.e., from the middle or the wings. In an ideal situation, the team can be highly compact when defending a lead (think: our solid defensive structure versus City), and highly dangerous when trying to overturn a deficit (think: Ivanovic‚Äôs winner against Napoli, and Chilwell‚Äôs recent banger against Watford).

## Leading from the back

As far as the back two are concerned, Rudiger‚Äôs replacement with Zouma in the past two games shows that Frank would prefer to partner a tactically intelligent centre-back like Christensen with a physically strong, aerially dominant, and commanding centre-back, similar to the Terry-Carvalho partnership. [All our centre-backs are poor communicators though](https://theathletic.com/1885351/2020/06/23/centre-backs-chelsea-koulibaly-upamecano-boateng-alaba-transfer-lampard/), so it is no surprise that Declan Rice is being considered as the Terry counterpart, as it is unsure whether Zouma has the leadership and quality to hold a first-team spot in the long term, in spite of his excellent defensive performances against Watford and Palace.

In fact, [*The Times* recently noted that Frank sees Rice as a successor to Terry](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/frank-lampard-wants-declan-rice-in-defence-9zksh96dh). [*The Athletic* too ran a piece on why Chelsea are interested in Rice as a centre-half](https://theathletic.co.uk/1903958/2020/07/02/chelsea-west-ham-declan-rice/#): ‚ÄúHe is commanding, has an aura about him and importantly talks/communicates really well‚Ä¶ He can play at the back really well because he has played there all his life. He‚Äôs a good passer of the ball too‚Ä¶ He is young and English too so you can see how he would fit in with what Chelsea are building there. A young squad that can play together for years to come.‚Äù

The added advantage of Rice is his ability to play as a defensive midfielder. After Kante's injury from being overplayed after the restart, along with Jorginho‚Äôs calamitous fall down the pecking order, Frank had a huge selection headache for the Palace game: who could possibly replace Kante? Billy got the nod, but much like many of the other younger players, he has struggled for consistency without a proper period of preparation. The huge space in the centre of the park where the Palace players combined before Zaha unleashed his rocket testifies to the need to play a defensive-minded player in that area of the pitch. While Jorginho definitely calmed the tempo down to dampen the onslaught towards the end, we still gave away sitters. The lesson to be learnt is simple: we *need* a replacement for Kante.

In fact, we haven‚Äôt ever had a reliable replacement for Kante, which has consistently resulted in him being overplayed and subsequently injured (Conte‚Äôs second season, and then the Europa League final). [Frank himself noted that Kante is 29 and he needs to manage his fitness differently](https://www.goal.com/en/news/lampard-kante-may-have-to-change-the-way-he-trains-to-keep/1ckldac5swngy19mg4qs4iqj1r), but clearly he can‚Äôt afford to make the same mistakes as his predecessors, so he needs to find a solution. [Rice‚Äôs talent in delaying and breaking up attacks during transition](https://www.coachesvoice.com/england-west-ham-declan-rice/#:~:text=Tactical%20analysis,of%20transition%20%E2%80%93%20testifies%20to%20this.) could be crucial in providing a much-needed option in that position.

## Rebuilding experience

So it‚Äôs clear then: Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz and Declan Rice are all players we have been linked with, mainly because their attributes provide all the missing pieces to the foundation that Frank wants to build at Chelsea for many years to come ‚Äî a foundation built from the pieces of our best memories of Chelsea under Mourinho and Ancelotti, during Frank‚Äôs peak playing days. Many of our (potential) new additions are capable of playing in different positions, fitting well with Frank‚Äôs own flavour of versatility in his tactical system. After the outlay on Werner and Ziyech, would we have the budget to sign all three of these players?

Each of their present clubs could find themselves in a precarious situation, leading to a cut-price deal. Leverkusen have already missed out on the CL; Leicester have fallen behind us to fourth place after last night‚Äôs draw against Arsenal, and they face another challenging game in North London before a final day showdown against United; and West Ham must battle it out in six-pointers against Villa and Watford to avoid relegation. Moreover, these additions would almost obviate the need to re-invest in subsequent years, especially if the cost is staggered in installments. It‚Äôs also expected that for each addition, there should be a departure to counterbalance it: for example, it looks as though [Emerson is heading out to Inter](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/hl1gb5/marcus_christenson_on_twitter_inter_open_talks/), which could offset the spend on Chilwell.

In spite of his cameo last night, it looks like [Jorginho is on his way out as well](https://theathletic.com/1915926/2020/07/08/jorginho-chelsea-lampard-frank-gilmour-sarri/), as he doesn‚Äôt fit Frank‚Äôs new midfield system. Much like Pedro and Emerson, Frank seems reluctant to rely upon players who are set to be playing elsewhere next season, and it‚Äôs entirely possible that he has had honest conversations with Jorgi about his reduced role in the first-team after shifting Kante deeper in midfield, with Jorgi indicating that he would prefer to leave for regular football elsewhere. His potential loss should not be underestimated: he is our current vice-captain, an important leader in the dressing room, an experienced professional, and a clinical penalty-taker.

Many of these qualities would be equally lost in Willian (and Pedro), signalling an exodus of much-needed experience to balance a young team. Moreover, signing Rice and Chilwell precludes us from going for more experienced counterparts in the market, such as Koulibaly and Tagliafico. If that is the case, we are unlikely to mount a serious title challenge in the immediate future. After all, look at the current champions: the ideal blend of youth and experience, with key players at the peak of their careers.

But their example should teach us another thing: as Klopp himself said recently, it was their experience of losing a CL final and a title race that spurred them on to win the next one. Frank knows this better than anybody else, after enduring through our long journey to the CL trophy. And so, this is exactly what he intends to build: a team that bleeds together for the coming few years, until it learns what it takes to win, setting the foundation for a team that can compete at the highest tier of English and European football for many years hence. We gain experience in the long-term by sacrificing it in the short-term: we don‚Äôt get the assurance of Jorgi or Willian stepping up to take a penalty at key junctures, only for the younger players to learn how to cope with the pressure.

## The academy and the warchest

Frank‚Äôs trust in the academy graduates this season has given us much to feel optimistic about, and still, it is our new transfers that may alienate them yet again. [Rice‚Äôs transfer will likely mean that Tomori will have to be loaned out](https://theathletic.co.uk/1911714/2020/07/06/declan-rice-chelsea-tomori-west-ham/). It would further foreclose any opening for Ampadu, who can similarly play across defence and midfield. His difficult spell at Leipzig means he would be loaned out again to a team that can promise him first-team action, which is probably for the best. While Billy might be expected to go out on loan in any case, the key issue here is whether he has the defensive ethic to play number 6 in Frank‚Äôs system. Especially after last night‚Äôs shaky defensive display against Palace, one would expect Rice to be ahead in the pecking order.

Frank indicated earlier that Billy can play in the number 8 position as well, but with Havertz‚Äôs addition, that position will certainly be crowded. Mount and Havertz would  stake the strongest claim, which would effectively render Kovacic, RLC, Barkley and Billy as squad options. While most of this sub would be happy to see the back of Barkley, some of our best performances this season have come when he has played, as seen in our superior win percentage with him in the team. He is a more than capable squad player: bought at a bargain, happy to take the opportunity when coming off the bench, and moreover, he executes Frank‚Äôs tactical instructions expertly.

There is a reason for that: he has matured immensely over the past couple of seasons under the tutelage of Sarri and Frank, into a well-balanced midfielder. I read a piece earlier this season (can‚Äôt find the link now) on how Frank has transformed Barkley from a player who would struggle to make decisions in the final third, into a repurposed Kovacic, using his ability to drive from deeper positions to great effect, which we first saw in the emphatic victory against Burnley. Alongside Mount, he perfectly balances the box-to-box movement of the number 8s, more than happy to do his defensive duties, which worked out well against City, Leicester and Watford. Setting aside the caricatured ‚ÄúRooooossss‚Äù for his recent performances then, he makes the best claim to be a squad option in number 8.

[There was a great hype around the return of RLC, especially after it was reported that he had a great pre-season before the restart](https://theathletic.com/1877509/2020/06/18/ruben-loftus-cheek-chelsea-comeback-premier-league/). But he‚Äôs looked like a shadow of the player we saw towards the end of last season before his injury, and now [Frank has suggested that we might only see the real RLC next season.](https://www.westlondonsport.com/chelsea/football-wls-chelsea-ruben-loftus-cheek-role-lampard-072021102) If he returns to his levels, as we all hope he will, he should be pushing Mount and Havertz for a first-team spot; but without regular first-team action, the addition of Havertz may just make it harder for him to establish himself once more.

Prior to the suspension, few would have disputed Kovacic‚Äôs claim to being our player of the season. After just a few rounds of fixtures since the restart, there are suddenly new candidates for the position: Pulisic, Mount and our veteran captain Azpilicueta (who gets my vote, for sure!). I would argue that this has everything to do with the change in tactical system: [Kovacic is the ideal foil for Jorginho](https://theathletic.com/1739690/2020/04/13/kante-chelsea-best-role-future-lampard/), as we saw in Sarri‚Äôs reign and earlier this season, but he fails to carry the forward threat that Frank demands from his number 8s. Sadly, the only player in the squad who played at the necessary level against Bayern (in Frank‚Äôs assessment), may in fact face a similar fate as Juan Mata did once his talents failed to fit a new tactical system.

Apart from displacing many a potential number 8, Havertz can *also* be expected to deputize for Ziyech on the right-wing, which we might earlier have expected from CHO. This means that our bumper contract young player will too have to go out on loan ‚Äî quite the fall from grace after having the pick of elite clubs not so long ago, [especially with Frank questioning his contribution to the first-team recently](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1305949/Chelsea-news-Frank-Lampard-Callum-Hudson-Odoi-Ruben-Loftus-Cheek). His contract has cast uncertainty on Tammy‚Äôs contract situation as well, and the future of yet another academy graduate could remain unresolved. Until his goal last night, Tammy‚Äôs season was looking uncomfortably similar to Morata‚Äôs first season: a prolific start to life, a struggle for consistency as the games came thick and fast, a fall in confidence, and then a distinct shift in body language for the worse. Just when we thought the curse of the number 9 had finally been lifted, it started rearing its ugly head once more.

Confidence is everything for a striker though (see: Vardy‚Äôs run-up to his 100th goal and his form thereafter), and [Tammy‚Äôs interview after last night‚Äôs goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRSxW-LdvOM&feature=emb_title) betrays shades of the player we all know he can be once more. As we all salivate over the prospect of an attacking trio of Pulisic-Werner-Ziyech, and as Giroud refuses to outlive his usefulness, can Tammy still prove that he is the successor to the King, as he indicated he might be after his iconic goal against Arsenal? Hopefully, his goal last night will set the pace for him to compete with our new additions. But apart from him and Mount, the others may have a much longer wait in their road to the first-team ‚Äî if they arrive there at all.

## The way forward

And so, the lessons from this season are mixed: just as we began to be excited about the academy finally getting its chance, the warchest has returned, and we are still caught between the conflicting desires to blood home-grown youngsters and compete at the level of the elite. The one thing that is clear though is that Frank is certainly the best manager to balance these contradictory pulls. He has defied all expectations this season with his resourcefulness and astute game-management, going head-to-head with the managerial elite and coming out victorious. He has given the academy a flavour of the first-team, and now he is challenging them to be worthy of it. The message is clear: I survived the original warchest era, can you? Some, like Mount, have responded with bravado, while some others might need to step it up a notch.

However things turn out, only the very best of our academy and our new signings will stay on to play in a tactical system that brings the best of Chelsea‚Äôs past together with the ever-changing demands of modern football. The future is fraught with challenges, but it certainly looks bright.",2218,2020-07-09 01:42:07,123

We need to back Sarri and end this toxic player power culture once and for all,https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/alupte/we_need_to_back_sarri_and_end_this_toxic_player/,"Until now I was still hoping for a new Hazard contract, thinking about what titles we might challenge for next season but now it's pretty clear this squad needs a rebuild, I don't even care anymore if we miss out on CL for next season, the most important thing is to have players who actually want to play for this club and manager. Keep players like Jorginho, Higuain who have a good relationship with Sarri and the ones who don't seem like they would ever turn against the manager like RLC, Kante, Kepa etc. ,players who actually want to play for the club and get rid of the ones that don't (Hazard, Willian, Luiz). Buy young motivated players like Lozano or Pepe and give Sarri time. It's impossible to have longterm success if the players don't get along with the manager, look at Klopp/Pep/Poch they are liked by all their players while our current players fall out with every single manager, all Juve players liked Conte, all Napoli players liked Sarri but our players have a problem with them of course. We are the only top club who has finished as bad as 10th and 5th in the last few years while winning the title in the former season, that can't be a coincidence
